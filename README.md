# E-commerce Backend 
[!WARNING]
Note: This system is still under construction and some important parts are missing.

E-commerce system implemented using Kotlin with Spring Boot. It serves as my sandbox for exploring topics and concepts like:
- Domain-Driven Design
- Modular Monolith
- Hexagonal Architecture
- CQRS
- Event-Sourcing

## Tools
- Kotlin
- Spring Boot
- ArrowKt
- MockK
- Kotest
- Exposed
- KediatR
- Docker Compose
- SeaweedFS
- nginx-s3-gateway
- Mailpit

- [Internal library](https://github.com/SzczygielDev/ecommerce-library) for this project with reusable building blocks

## Building
To build this application, you'll need to be [authenticated to GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages), this is necessary to access internal library required for the project.
